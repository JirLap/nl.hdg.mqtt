With this app you can communicate with all your devices connected to Homey using MQTT.  
The MQTT Hub automatically broadcasts all your devices and their capabilities. 
It will setup a communication channel per device, so external apps can find and control each one of them.
Furthermore it provides an interface to read the full system state & and allows advanced control of your Homey, without the need to write your own app.  
Auto discovery protocols are implemented to simplify the setup and connection with external apps.
