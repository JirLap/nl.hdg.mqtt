- [REFACTOR] De-couple parse & format logic. Refactor data processing. Create handlers per type?

Homie:
- Use ValueParser
- Do NOT retain messages for non-getable capabilities (button)
- Introduce queue for updating device state (use brightness slider ha app)
- Device Aliasses (e.g. dim/brightness, light temperature, etc.)
- Publish onoff message on dim && dim when switching onoff?
- Fix RGB
- (listen to) broadcasts
- Zone depth > 1 (folder structure)

App:
! unsubscribe from topics on MQTT Client (e.g. Uninstall app / topic switch)
- [BUG] disabling devices it removed them from the homie/homey topic tree but created another named literally homie/deviceID
- [Check] Refresh devices on device/zone changes + Broadcast
- Flow card to trigger a broadcast
- Translate to Dutch
- Translate to German

MQTT Device:
! unsubscribe from topics on uninstall
- Handle (un)installing of MQTT app
- Icons (fa/mdi apps)
- Display topics in capabilities list?
- Edit topics during install
- availablility topic
- Custom capabilities
- Translations
- value templates
- auto detect on/off values (setting) from state topic
- auto fill set topic while typing state topic
- Disconnect MQTT client on done
- Color (+ device setting)

Discovery (auto discover external devices):
! Styling bug empty list discovered devices (empty row?)
! [Check] Capability matches Nefit
- Detect already configured devices & mark them created
- [Bug] Close button does not react (discovered devices view)
- Implement HA discovery
- Keep a record of previous discovery topic
- Disconnect MQTT client on done

Commands:
- Updating state for multiple devices (e.g. all devices in a room) == Homie broadcast?
- Trigger flow
- Info requests:
  * System
  * Device classes
  * Zones
  * ...
- Listen to scene flow triggers

Insights / System info:
- Publish system info on seperate topics (i.s.o. json)
- (All) Prometheus functionality

MQTT Client app:
! Api to unregister topics (ref counter)
! send retained topic messages on (re)connect?
- fix required app restarts
- icon
